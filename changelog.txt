0.7.0 (2009-04-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Watermark crash.sav and do not generate crash information if a loaded crash.sav causes a crash so the real crash report does not get overwritten (r15893)

- Fix: Chat completion got called twice causing tab completion to seemingly fail (r15905)
- Fix: YAPF did not apply the platform length (too long/too short) penalties (r15900)
- Fix: Fixing the slopes was done a bit more often than intended making map generation with the original generator horribly slow (r15895)
- Fix: YAPF used different penalties for aqueducts than for other water tiles (r15891)
- Fix: Round the production rate up, so e.g. oilrigs always produce some passengers on lowest production level [FS#2772] (r15888)
- Fix: Libtimidity cannot handle frees of NULL (in contrast of most other frees) [FS#2770] (r15886)

- Fix: [Windows] Inlined UTF-8 characters (in the source code) are not handled properly on Eastern versions of Windows so escape them (r15762)
- Fix: [Windows] On some system searching a font using its English name fails. So now we search the font using the localised name and use the English name for the final 'validation' only (r15757)
- Fix: Number of houses in house variables 0x44, 0x60 and 0x61 were incorrect after 0xFF had been reached and could desync clients joining afterwards (r15755)
- Fix: Crash when clicking the small area between the savegame list and the save button in the save game window [FS#2742] (r15753)
- Fix: Do not try to (un)draw the cursor when the screen is not ready (r15752)
- Fix: The big UFO sometimes landed just outside the map. Instead of landing, just disappear (fly away) in those cases (r15750)

- Fix: Centering on a vehicle did not respect its z coordinate (r15725)
- Fix: Do not show passenger-/mail-capacity if the aircraft carries only cargo (r15705)
- Fix: Blame NewGRFs returning inconsistent information in purchase-list/after building before users have a chance to blame OpenTTD for incorrectly autorenewing/-replacing [FS#2595] (r15701)
- Fix: Just sell the old engines after autorenew/replace. Do not bother about trains exceeding the trainlimit, which will be sold anyway [FS#2721] (r15692)
- Fix: Do not crash when the generate map does not contain a suitable location for a town [FS#2720] (r15689)
- Fix: Do not crash when someone substitutes the "map generation" sprites with garbage [FS#2720] (r15685)
- Fix: Vehicle images would be determined during the process of moving the vehicle which means that only the (orientation) data for the vehicles in front of it is valid. Now the data for the vehicles behind the vehicle are valid too [FS#2546] (r15677)
- Fix: It was possible to remove rail tunnels/bridges and aqueducts build by rival companies [FS#2718] (r15667)
- Fix: Sorting of engines in the purchase list did not use the same numbers as the GUI showed, e.g. articulated parts were not taken into accound when ordering by capacity [FS#2689] (r15666)
- Fix: Handling of aircraft crash counter did not take account of the reduced number of calls (from 6 down to 2) to the aircraft event handler, resulting in crashed aircraft taking three times longer than they should to clear. Compensate by increasing the counter by 3 on every call instead of 1 (r15665)
- Fix: Growing of vsize as (some) threads were not properly released (r15663)
- Fix: Do not mark a company as having ratings in a town when querying the cost of a command (r15662)

- Change: Allow the default debug level of 6 for a dedicated server to be overriden by -d (if used after -D) (r15543)
- Change: [NewGRF] To decide whether a vehicle is refittable do not test its current capacity for being zero, but always use the 'capacity property' (r15541)
- Fix: [Squirrel] Almost infinite loop in garbage collection (r15659)
- Fix: Undeterministic file sorting when the date is equal for all files [FS#2716] (r15657)

- Fix: Only ever call any vehicle callbacks after the whole articulated engine has been built (except 0x16) (r15654)
- Fix: new (this) is seldom a good idea as destructors of member variables are not run causing memory leaks [FS#2706] (r15652)
- Fix: [OSX] Hack around an OSX stupidity in < 10.4 w.r.t. signals by not having any signal handling support for OSX < 10.4 (r15648)

- Fix: Closing a network connection twice in the case that sending packets starts failing while disconnecting [FS#2710] (r15644)
- Fix: Game crashes when network pools are empty, so always allocate at least one pool block [FS#2712] (r15641)
- Fix: Do not allow more than 64 road vehicles to reserve a slot at a single road stop. 255 + 1 gives trouble, but 64 is even more than the roadstop would be able to handle within the slot timeout time [FS#2707] (r15635)
- Fix: Kicking/banning a client from the Client list window crashed the server [FS#2705] (r15628)
- Fix: UTF8 string handling could cause buffer overruns [FS#2698] (r15626)
- Fix: When trying to reserve a self-crossing path the failed reservation was sometimes not cleared completely [FS#2701] (r15619)

- Fix: Theoretical buffer overflow when a company with too long name funded a road reconstruction (r15572)
- Fix: When building signals by dragging from a pre/entry/combo block signal, the signal you started at became a normal block signal [FS#2674] (r15567)
- Fix: Dependency information was not requested after the content state was reset causing the dependencies not always being selected (and thus downloaded) automatically [FS#2675] (r15565)
- Fix: Crash when saving a preset with unknown NewGRFs [FS#2646] (r15561)
- Fix: The font width cache was not updated when changing fonts causing the font spacing to be off when changing fonts in-game (auto font detection) (r15557)
- Fix: -v null crashing in 2051 due to trying to show the high score of the spectator (r15554)
- Fix: [NoAI] crash when setting a depot order to the southern part of a ship depot [FS#2656] (r15551)
- Fix: keep_all_autosave was ignored for dedicated servers/spectators [FS#2651] (r15546)
- Fix: If a buoy was placed directly in front of a dock, that dock was seen as a buoy and thus skipped once within 3 tiles [FS#2653] (r15545)
- Fix: Extracting downloaded content did not work for Windows if one uses a non-ASCII path [FS#2650] (r15544)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When articulated parts have no available default cargo, use the cargo type of the first part for livery selection [FS#2617] (r15541)
- Fix: Testing of 'only_this' in CmdRefitRoadVeh() could be skipped by 'continue' (r15540)
- Fix: [NewGRF] If an aircraft cannot carry any available cargo, it should not be available either instead of falling back to passenger/mail. Just like the other vehicle types also do (r15539)
- Fix: Do not allow special sprite characters (e.g. the ship sprite) as characters in input like filenames or text that is sent over the network (r15537)
- Fix: The local command queue did not get properly cleaned when leaving a game meaning you could end up executing commands of the previous network game [FS#2644] (r15529)
- Fix: Do not try to find the AIs the server runs when joining a multiplayer server (r15525)
- Fix: Use distance to closest station tile as estimate for YAPF too (NPF already does so). This makes it behave 'better' with wide stations [FS#2631] (r15518)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Wagonoverrides and articulated engine parts use the colour scheme of the engine, but not its recolour callback, nor its 2CC flag. Same applies to roadvehicles [FS#2642] (r15517)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Livery overrides for articulated parts of roadvehicles were not applied (r15516)
- Fix: Make the join/spectate command require to be connected to a network game; in SP it could lead to crashes (r15514)
- Fix: Generating a map with the original map generator with freeform edges on resulted in a crash [FS#2641] (r15511)
- Fix: Pre-0.5 OTTD stored new_nonstop and full_load_any in a different way, savegame conversion was not working for them (r15500)
- Fix: Crash when opening the game options when the currently loaded base graphics pack has less than 2 valid graphics files. For example when someone replaces all his/her original base graphics with custom work (but keeps the name) or renames the dos ones to windows or vice versa [FS#2630] (r15476)


0.7.0-beta1 (2009-02-16)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Make it possible to have multiple windows with edit box open simultaniously (r15424)
- Feature: Add ability to select which base graphics set is used from the Game Options window. The change takes effect when the window is closed. This option can only be used from the intro menu, as reloading graphics during a game may cause issues (r15389)
- Feature: Do not draw superfluous catenary wires [FS#1761] (r15347)

- Feature: [NewGRF] Allow a grf to customize house name via callback 0x14D, during Tile Inquiry process (r15172)
- Feature: Downloading content from a central server (content.openttd.org) where authors can upload their NewGRFS/AI etc. This should make joining servers that use only NewGRFs that are distributed via this system easier as the players can download the NewGRFs from within the game. It should also make it easier to see whether there are updates for NewGRFs and make the necessary updates (r15126)
- Feature: Add support for IP range bans using CIDR notation (r15094)
- Feature: An AI framework so people can write their own AIs. This also removes the old cheating and heavily broken AI (r15027)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Support var 0x45 (curvature info) also for road vehicles (r14945)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Automatically set last engine ageing year to the last 'introduction year plus half model life', to allow engines later than 2050 to appear (r14926)
- Feature: Distant joining of stations (r14919)
- Feature: Advanced setting to keep various building tools active, which are usually closed after placing an object (r14902)
- Feature: Remove the window limit, but leave a configurable limit on the number of non-sticky non-vital windows (r14899)
- Feature: Allow road vehicles to move multiple steps in a tick (code based on train movement code) and add support for RV prop 15. This gives RVs a maximum speed of 318mph instead 79mph. This only implements higher speeds, not 'realistic acceleration' (r14869)
- Feature: Automatic reversing in front of block signals can now be disabled by setting pf.wait_oneway_signal respectively pf.wait_twoway_signal to 255 (r14852)
- Feature: Few (optional) optimisations to making (initial) orders; like keeping goto selected [FS#1984] (r14827)
- Feature: Make the road grids of town match, when all are using the same road layout ofcourse [FS#2390] (r14821)

- Feature: Allow up to 255 clients in multiplayer games (r14730)
- Feature: When the chosen language is not supported by the current font, try to find a font that does and use that instead (r14618)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Action0Industries property 24 (industry supplies default name for nearby station) (r14598)
- Feature: Non-destructive autofill with option to keep waiting times [FS#1124] (r14592)
- Feature: Stop-in-depot order; after this order you have to manually start the vehicle again (or sell it) (r14524)
- Feature: Arrow key scrolling in the server list (r14517)
- Feature: Initial support for handling bidirectional scripts and connecting Arabic characters (r14479)
- Feature: Allow sorting vehicles by remaining life time (r14352)
- Feature: Ability to reset name to default/automatic value (for vehicles, engines, towns, groups, stations, waypoints, managers and companies) (r14334)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add Variational Action 2 Variable 0x47 for houses, Coordinates of the house tile (r14294)
- Feature: Allow overriding the palette of the base GRFs. This way you can play with NewGRFs made for the Windows palette with the DOS palettes base GRFs (and vice versa). Note that for this to work correctly ALL NewGRFs must use the same palette; mix and match is not yet supported (r14229)
- Feature: Double click to join selected server/company (r14209)
- Feature: Allow both the German as well as non-German toyland graphics as "correct" and official graphics (r14197)
- Feature: Allow people to create their own base graphics easily and without requiring code changes (r14197)
- Feature: [NewGRF]: Add support for property 0x13 for Bridges. In other words, one can now specifies a 16 bits cost multiplier (r14172)
- Feature: Make it possible to choose between the DOS and Windows graphics packs while retaining the possibility to override the palette (r14151)
- Feature: Increase the size of the console backlog. Now it'll only remove backlog items when there are more than a threshold and when they are there longer than (another) threshold (r14056)
- Feature: Make it possible to filter list_patches output like it's done for other list_* console commands (r14041)
- Feature: Path based signalling (r13926-13967)
- Feature: Show [total-]cargo info in depot when [ctrl-]right-clicking on vehicle (r13923)
- Feature: NewGRF presets, selected by a drop down list in the NewGRF window. Presets are saved in the config file (r13781)
- Feature: Add a few extra columns with information to the server list (r13732)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 65 in Variational Action 2 Variables for Houses (r13603)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement var 63, variational action2 variable for Houses. Or, in more simple terms, the check for the animation frame of nearby house (r13519)
- Feature: Aqueducts (r13464)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 0x69 for industries, long format construction date (r13443)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add long format introduction and maximum construction year for house (r13437)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add access to current long year and date from Action 7/9/D and VarAction2 (23/24 or A3/A4), and add access to (long format) building year, in Variational Action2 Variable 49 for Vehicles (r13376)
- Feature: Splitting of the main toolbar when the resolution becomes very low so the buttons are still visible and useable (r13339)
- Feature: Make news messages use a linked list instead of a moving circular buffer. This makes it possible to store more news messages in the history (r13317)
- Feature: The number of news messages is reduced by removing every news message that is a configurable amount older than when it would not be shown in the newspaper popup/ticker, which is e.g. a month for industry production changes and half a year for subsidy offers. As a result the more important messages will stay longer in the message history (if longer than 30 messages) (r13317)
- Feature: Allow to have more than only two airports per town.  The number of airports is now controlled by the noise each of them generates, the distance from town's center and how tolerant the town is (13226)
- Feature: Introducing the so called 'engine pool' which primarily removes the fixed engine type limits and also happens to allow (with the patch option 'dynamic_engines') multiple NewGRF vehicle sets to coexist (r12924)
- Feature: [NewGRF] The ability to play NewGRF sounds for industries and stations (r12817)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add some support for NewGRF station animation (r12798)
- Feature: Sorting vehicle lists by road vehicle/train length (r12766)

- Feature: Ability to send a vehicle (using default orders) to the nearest depot (r12661)
- Feature: Ability to force a vehicle to not load or to not unload at a station (r12650)
- Feature:  Four different non-stop types, individually selectable per order. Replaces "TTDP compatible order" setting (r12648)
- Feature: Three different load type in a single game instead of two. One can choose full load all and full load any instead of full load being governed by the "full load any" patch setting (r12648)
- Feature: Financial and Player Selection Face windows are now remembering their position when toggling sizes (r12634)
- Feature: Show what cargos a station could be supplied with (r12596)

- Feature: Open the time table when pressing the order button while pressing the CTRL key (r12441)
- Feature: On Screen Keyboard for input fields so someone without a keyboard can enter text too [FS#1846] (r12425)
- Change: When checking for unique names, compare only with manually set names [FS#1923] (r14958)
- Change: Apply the 'warn if train's income is negative' setting to other vehicle types, too (r14835)
- Change: When loading games in "network" mode use the start date of the save game for the server and all clients when loading the NewGRFs instead of the current date. Prevents desyncs caused by action 7/9s skipping parts of the GRF based on the date or some other variables that can differ at NewGRF load time (r14769)
- Change: Only say a engine/vehicle is refittable when it can be refitted to at least two cargo type or when it has subcargos (r14683)
- Change: [NewGRF] Since our NewGRF handling is better than it used to be, disable a NewGRF if unexpected sprites are reached (r14184)
- Fix: A town could build a statue under a bridge [FS#2618] (r15397)
- Fix: Multiple vehicles could be filling the timetable and only the data from one vehicle would be taken. Now only allow one to be filling at a time [FS#2466] (r15382)
- Fix: When testing for parallel road two tiles away, do not move more than one tile along the road (r15381)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The subcargo returned by vehicle variable 0x42 should be the most-common-subcargo of the most-common-cargo. If nothing is transported 0x..FFFF00 should be returned (r15378)
- Fix: A tram circling around in a depot did never actually 'enter' the depot [FS#2605] (r15375)
- Fix: Changing town road layout in-game caused ugly road networks [FS#2121] (r15340)
- Fix: Company could never have auto-assigned colour 0 (dark blue) (r15281)
- Fix: Deadlock (with wide fonts) or desync when generating manager name (r15279)
- Fix: Close all windows *before* starting a new game/loading a game instead of doing that as one of the latest steps of loading the game. This caused, in some cases, the NewGRF settings to be reset when the game was already loaded resulting in instant desyncs when joining a network game [FS#2577] (r15256)
- Fix: Aircraft could be 'loading in the air' or have zero speed while in air after converting old savegames [FS#2571] (r15230, r15227)
- Fix: Tile error location not reset when leveling land causing a tile to be highlighted when there was nothing to flatten [FS#2542] (r15138)
- Fix: Signs with sign 'Sign' were lost when converting from TTD savegames (r15137)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Add support for 8 byte action7/9 data, used as a mask for GRFID checks (r15114)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Keep industry variables 8E and 8F in sync with 93, when changing production using results 0D, 0E or 0F of callback 29 or 35 (r15103)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a NewGRF from loading if it contains multiple Action 8s (r14979)
- Fix: Wrong defaults for service interval when switching between service interval in days and service interval in percentages [FS#2508] (r14959)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Building new station parts did not allocate a new station spec effectively breaking variable 41. This was due to the limited number of station specs that we can have per station. This fix makes newly build station parts create a new spec until one cannot allocate new station specs anymore and it'll revert to the old behaviour (sharing station specs) [FS#1832] (r14956)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Station specs did not get deallocated when building a new station part over them (r14955)
- Fix: Sharing/cloning/inserting of orders that the/a vehicle (in the shared list) cannot go to (wrong station type etc) [FS#1890] (r14954)
- Fix: The "animation state" of the bubbles was stored in a variable that was not stored in the savegame. Using a variable that gets saved in the savegame solves the desync and makes it a bit clearer [FS#2512] (r14931)
- Fix: Abort dragging of vehicles in the group window when they are deleted [FS#2500] (r14925)
- Fix: Do not unnecessarily reset the cursor, when a different vehicle is dragged (r14924)
- Fix: [NewGRF] First create all articulated parts of roadvehicles, then call callback 36 capacity, also call it for all articulated parts (r14903)
- Fix: Overflow of number of orders per vehicle [FS#2495] (r14830)
- Fix: Off-by-one causing possible out-of-bounds reads (r14811)
- Fix: In an MP game in SP mode no company would go bankrupt. Furthermore companies that passed the "bankrupt" period (4 quarters) would not go bankrupt when loading the game back in MP. Now any company that is in MP or not "currently controlled by the player" in SP will bankrupt [FS#1993] (r14750)
- Fix: Do not let any disaster vehicle (Helicopter or Airplane) target invalid industry (r14746)
- Fix: Memory leak in Action 0x0F (new town names) (r14737)
- Fix: Writing a single char to the config file caused reading outside a buffer (r14729)
- Fix: First transfer the whole load of a vehicle chain to industries before triggering any processing. This reduces callback usage and resolves critical rounding errors when using input-cargo-multipliers instead of production callbacks [FS#2460] (r14705)
- Fix: Zeppeliner (disaster) should target st->airport_tile, not st->xy (r14694)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Gradual filling graphics were not chosen according to the NewGRF spec [FS#2435] (r14678)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Check sprite size when executing action 6 (r14674)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Property 7 and callback 12 were broken for aircraft. Now callback 12 is properly called also for 'mail'. If the callback is not used, 'mail' uses 1/4 of property 7 (rounded up) [FS#2444] (r14672)
- Fix: Possible stack corruption when reading corrupted sprites [FS#2415] (r14610)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Return the current year as construction year for unfinished houses (r14608)

- Fix: The company ID is off-by-one with respect to the rest of the GUI in the cheat window [FS#2422] (r14603)
- Fix: The range for kicking/banning clients is based on the maximum number of clients, not the maximum number of companies [FS#2414] (r14588)
- Fix: Allow capacity callbacks (15, 36) to return zero capacity (r14578)
- Fix: Crashes when a NewGRF sends an invalid string [FS#2395] (r14563)
- Fix: Order pool seemed to look full when it was not as it only checked whether it was possible to allocate a new block of pool items instead of checking for free pool items (r14547)
- Fix: Do not deliver cargo to industries not inside station catchment area [FS#2138] (r14530)
- Fix: Allocate stub (empty) sound entries when loading an empty/corrupt/incorrectly sized sample.cat instead of making valid NewGRFs fail to load (r14527)
- Fix: Make sure trains stop at the end of a station; a 3/8th length train did stop 2/8th of it's length too early causing a 63/8th long train not to fit in a 4 tile station [FS#2379] (r14526)
- Fix: Small possible chance of desync due to sorting on pointer instead of by (station) index [FS#2348] (r14463)
- Fix: When a road stop gets moved make sure to update the destination of RVs going to that road stop [FS#2330] (r14446)
- Fix: Support for spaces in directories passed to ./configure [FS#1802] (r14440)
- Fix: Trains would sometimes move one time too often/little when moving from diagonal<->non-diagonal tracks [FS#1793] (r14436)
- Fix: Balance the monthly random industry changes, by introducing a daily random industry change [FS#1885] (r14332)
- Fix: Save the palette of the loaded NewGRFs in the savegame, so joining with a server using Windows palette will make a client with the DOS palette do palette conversion and (thus) not cause a desync (r14233)
- Fix: Glitches (alignment issues/inconsistent vehicle graphics) in original graphics (r14214, r14211)
- Fix: One could not get a list of vehicles sharing an order when the number of orders was 0; you could see that the vehicles had a shared order though [FS#2085] (r14097)
- Fix: Various assorted autoreplace issues/malbehaviours [FS#1264, FS#2037, FS#2038, FS#2110] (r14083)
- Fix: The autoreplace gui showed vehicle types for replacement which CmdSetAutoReplace() did not accept (r14037)
- Fix: Automatically recalculate inflation if NewGRFs are changed and cargo types are added, so that cargo payment rates are correct [FS#2074] (r13836)


0.6.3 (2008-10-01)

- Fix: Free any blocks that a helicopter may have on an oilrig when the helicopter gets forcefully removed (bankruptcy). For other airports this isn't needed as they can't be used by multiple companies [FS#2241] (r14324)
- Fix: Possible assert when renaming removed waypoint (r14322)
- Fix: Properly delete orders so the pool doesn't fill up (r14319)
- Fix: Do not allow building road over level crossings and drive-through road stops in the wrong direction; do not allow adding roadtypes to non-drive through road stops; pay for all added road bits [FS#2268] (r14316, r14315, r14314, r14308)
- Fix: Aircraft frozen above oil rig when the next order is invalid [FS#2244] (r14309)
- Fix: [YAPF] Only reserve road slots for multistop when they are really reachable [FS#2294] (r14305)
- Fix: One could be trying to get the station name of a station that is outside of the pool (r14297)
- Fix: Default for sound effects and music volume should be in the valid range for that setting [FS#2286] (r14289)
- Fix: Make small UFO aware of articulated RVs so they crash the complete vehicle instead of a small part of it (r14270)
- Fix: Desyncs after deleting a waypoint because of explicit destructor call instead of using operator delete (r14265)
- Fix: Merge keycode for "normal" 0-9 keys and keypad 0-9 keys so people do not get confused that the keypad does not work as expected [FS#2277] (r14260)
- Fix: Clicking on the smallmap didn't break the "follow vehicle in main viewport" [FS#2269] (r14243)
- Fix: The engine-purchase-list-sorter doubled running-cost and halfed capacity of double-headed engines [FS#2267] (r14239)
- Fix: Feeder share was computed wrong when splitting cargo packet (r14234)
- Fix: Signs (town name, station name, ...) could be too long for 8bit width in pixels (r14221)

- Fix: Division by 0 in NewAI [FS#2226] (r14062)
- Fix: NewGRF callback 23 did not use the NewGRF compatible text stack [FS#2224] (r14058)
- Fix: NewGRF text stack's "push word" didn't move the data around properly (r14057)
- Fix: Long strings in the edit box would cause OpenTTD to stop drawing the string. This is especially noticable with low resolutions and the chat input box (r14054)
- Fix: [OSX] changed the condition for selecting 8 or 32 bpp blitter by default. Now we will pick 32 bpp if no 8 bpp fullscreen resolutions are available on the main display (the one with the dock) (r14032)
- Fix: Crash when the AI tries to find the depot of an airport that doesn't have a depot [FS#2190] (r13999)

- Fix: Check for vehicle length changes outside a depot (callback 0x11) and give a warning about that [FS#2150] (r13816)
- Fix: Several minor memory leaks. They only happened once per game (r13809, 13810)

- Fix: Some revision checking code was unintentionally disabled (r13776)
- Fix: Enforce the validity of a NetworkAction (chat packet) issued by a client (r13775)
- Fix: Selecting non-full length vehicles in the depot gui would place the "mouse pointer" out of the center of the vehicle making it hard to "aim" [FS#2147] (r13759)
- Fix: NewGRF rail continuation would always mark a tunnel on the same axis as connected, even when the tunnel faces the wrong direction (r13734)
- Fix: Assumption that non-north tiles of a house do not have the 1x1 building bit set was flawed with some NewGRFs. This caused the amount of houses to differ, which causes the town radii to differ, which causes desyncs when towns are expanded (r13729)
- Fix: Possible desync on the autorenew settings 20+ game years (i.e. 4.5+ hours) after a company was started (r13718)
- Fix: Any player could construct new companies [FS#2144] (r13716)

- Fix: Make sure a command is ran in the context of autoreplace or not (r13691)
- Fix: In the case that elrails and 'realistic' acceleration are disabled all electrified engines would have no power on load, until the vehicle got turned around, loaded or got into a depot [FS#2102]- Fix: Saving TTD imported games in recession failed due to wrong (and unneeded) type conversions in the saveload code [FS#2131] (r13679)
- Fix: Inactive companies from old (TTD) saves could be marked active in some cases, which then loads garbage in their statistics and such [FS#2126] (r13676)

- Fix: Crash when drawing a non-real sprite caused by NewGRF interference [FS#2127] (r13674)

- Fix: Only the front of a RV would be considered when determining to what cargos a vehicle can be refitted instead of all cargos [FS#2109] (r13622)
- Fix: If the first bridge can not be build for a given length, then none of the other bridges can. Effectively meaning that if someone replaces the first bridge with a bridge that can be only 3 tiles longs then only other bridges that can be 3 tiles long will be buildable, but only if they are 3 tiles long [FS#2100] (r13611)
- Fix: Signal states could be propagated through waypoints built in orthogonal axis (r13589)
- Fix: [OSX] 10.5 failed to switch to fullscreen (r13584)
- Fix: RVs continueing onto next DT station when they are build adjacent to them [FS#2040] (r13581)
- Fix: Disable static NewGRFs when non-static NewGRFs query them in the context of network games. This makes it impossible for static NewGRFs to disable non-static NewGRFs and 'bad' things happening because the non-static NewGRF doesn't know about the static NewGRF (r13576)
- Fix: Properly count number of non-north housetiles [FS#2083] (r13518)
- Fix: Incorrect usage of strtoul (r13508)
- Fix: Clear the memory for the new AI during the loading of a savegame so it does not try to execute commands generated in a different savegame, which could be resulting in the AI trying to give orders to stations that do not exist (r13505)
- Fix: Drawing of zoomed out partial sprites could cause deadlocks or crashes (r13502)
- Fix: First determine where to *exactly* build a house before asking a NewGRF whether the location is good instead of possibly moving the house a tile after the NewGRF said the location is good (r13489)
- Fix: Track was not removed on company bankrupcy when there was a ship on lower halftile (r13488)
- Fix: Let ships also navigate on half-tile sloped watery rail tiles (r13485)

- Fix: Do not crash when resolving vehicle sprite groups with zero sprites (r13397)
- Fix: In the purchase list, CB36 for capacity was not called for the first part of rail and road vehicles (r13385)
- Fix: Loading of very old OpenTTD savegames was broken (r13373)

- Fix: Reading/modifying invalid data under some circumstances (r12943)
- Fix: Minor errors related to industries accepted/produced cargo (r12933)
- Fix: Town rating was affected even after the test run (r12920)
- Fix: Flood road tiles even when there are road works in progress [FS#1965] (r12919)
- Fix: Do not initialize Station struct with tile=0, buoys will never change that value [FS#1960] (r12915)
- Fix: Game crash when a spectator/server tried to show an engine with no owner when a NewGRF requested a specific variable (r12914)
- Fix: Report reverse sprite status (FD/FE) to NewGRF for manually toggled vehicles (r12910)
- Fix: Vehicles going twice to a depot when the automatic service interfered with the current order [FS#1985] (r12629)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Vehicle groups, engine replacement rules and player/company names were not properly reset/freed after bankrupt (r12906)
- Fix: Remove trams from savegames saved in OTTD without tram support, it is better than to simply crash [FS#1953] (r12904)
- Fix: GCC on FreeBSD does not support -dumpmachine causing configure to fail. Use g++ instead [FS#1928] (r12876)
- Fix: Make the town rating tests use less memory and much quicker (r12859)
- Fix: Usage of AutoPtr made (trying to) build stuff very (time) expensive (r12857, r12855)

- Fix: Possible out of bounds array access (r12809)
- Fix: Enforce autorenew values range in command (r12808)
- Fix: Vehicles could break down during loading and keep loading. The intention of the break down code is not to break down when having zero speed, therefor break downs now do not happen when loading [FS#1938] (r12795)
- Fix: [OSX] In some rare cases when using an uncalibrated monitor the system colour space could not be retrieved. Show an error when this happens instead of just trying an assertion (r12776)

- Fix: Removing road pieces from a town gave you twice the intended penalty [FS#1920] (r12682)
- Fix: When a road vehicle has a tram only stop multiple times in a row in it's orders, only the first one would be skipped [FS#1918] (r12678)
- Fix: Colour remaps on station sprites only worked for company colours [FS#1902] (r12674)
- Fix: Remove buggy buoys at tile 0 from old TTDP savegames (r12642)

- Feature: Sort the NewGRFs by name, making searching a specific NewGRF a lot easier (r11175)
- Feature: Add possibility to show the bounding boxes of sprites using CTRL-B so one can get a better understanding of the used bounding boxes to fix the glitches that still exist. Note that showing the bounding boxes is not glitch free; it only gives you some knowledge where the bounding boxes are (r11174)
- Feature: Remove the arbitrary limit of 10 articulated parts for a vehicle (r11120)
- Feature: Autoslope, changing of slopes of tiles that already have something build on them. Does not work for tiles of houses/industries/stations that do not allow autosloping (r11107)
- Feature: Support for encapsulating files into a .tar file; you can pack all files in your data/ directory in how ever many .tar files you like, keeping the directory-structure equal to the unpacked version, and OpenTTD can handle them just like the files were unpacked (r11106)
- Feature: Allow slopes under statues (r11069)
- Feature: [OSX] Added more options for right click emulation (controlled from the interface tab in the patch window) (r10996)

- Feature: Provide an infrastructure to have resizable windows that are smaller than the default window size. Useful for playing on very low resolution systems (r10704)
- Feature: Support for autosave_on_exit in the console, so dedicated servers can use it (r10658)
- Feature: Add a soft limit of 4096 "entities" in a station's waiting queue and a hard limit of 32768 so (malicious) people cannot cause a "denial of service" attack by filling cargo lists (r10555)
- Feature: Replace all the windows for Industry building by a more flexible one (r10496)
- Feature: Support for "prospecting" raw industries, i.e. you pay an amount of money and then it might (with a given chance) build a raw industry somewhere on the map (r10451)
- Feature: Automatic signal completion, enabled by pressing CTRL when dragging signals. Signals will continue following track until an existing signal, junction or station are reached. This currently replaces the existing use of CTRL-drag for changing existing signal type (r10437)
- Feature: New sign editor features including switching to previous/next sign (r10401)
- Feature: Disallow (in the GUI) the building of infrastructure you do not have available vehicles for. This means that the airport building button is disabled till you can actually build aircraft. The game itself will not disallow you to build the infrastructure and this "new" behaviour can be overridden with a patch setting [FS#669] (r10353)
- Feature: Add the possibility of automatically filling in timetables based on the times from the first (or subsequent) run-throughs (r10331)
- Feature: Option to select the "default" rail type when you start a new game or load a game. This is done either static, i.e. rail, electrified rail, monorail and maglev, or dynamic which takes either the first or last available railtype or the railtype that is used most on the map [FS#812] (r10329)
- Feature: Give a better explanation why the loading of a savegame failed and do not crash on loading savegames that were altered by patches or branches [FS#917] (r10300)

- Feature: Advanced vehicle lists a.k.a. group interface. Now you can make groups of vehicles and perform all kinds of tasks on that given group (r9874)
- Feature: Make "improved loading" a proper improved loading instead of loading one (semi-)random vehicle at a time. Furthermore fill multiple vehicles at once when there is enough cargo to do so (r9838)
- Feature: Add drag and drop removal of station tiles (r9810)
- Feature: Support for "curvature info", Action 2 for train, variable 45 (r9803)

- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for Action 13, which allows you to translate GRF-specific texts. The translations will only be shown if you are using a language with a GRF language id and if a string has not already been set specifically for the language you are using (r9037)
- Feature: Translation dependant formatting of dates (r8906)
- Feature: If an action 7/9 leads to skipping the rest of the file, disable the NewGRF if an action 8 has not been encountered yet (r8831)
- Feature: Stop loading and disable the current NewGRF if a fatal error message in Action B is encountered. Also be more strict on the values accepted (r8830)

- Feature: Increase sprite limit from 16384 sprites to 16777216 sprites (r8128, r8129)
- Feature: Add the ability to load savegames when you do not have the exact GRF files in your list. GRF files that are found based on GRF ID (but not on matching md5sum) are used instead of disabling them. This does not affect MP games, there you still need an exact match (r8106)
- Feature: Show the activated status of the GRF list after pressing 'apply' in the NewGRF window, instead of the local list (r8094)

- Feature: Allow to build bridges of arbitrary rail/road combinations (including signals) (r7573)
- Codechange: Do not allow configuration changes, that NewGRFs can directly use to change their behaviour, during network games as this can cause desyncs (r11452)
- Codechange: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it [FS#1310] (r11256)
- Codechange: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)
- Codechange: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)
- Codechange: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)
- Codechange: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)
- Codechange: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)
- Codechange: Don't redraw all station tiles when cargo is added or removed if the station has no custom graphics (r10062)
- Codechange: Add some support for NewGRF var 7D, temporary storage array (r9707)

- Codechange: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)
- Codechange: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)
- Fix: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)
- Fix: Do not create shores in canyons (r11438)
- Fix: Starting OpenTTD with DOS files made it look weird out of the box (r11433)
- Fix: Properly support genders coming from NewGRFs instead of crashing [FS#1430] (r11422)
- Fix: Do not ignore the autorenew settings for new games when creating a new game [FS#1428] (r11415)
- Fix: Do not do a 270 degree turn when 90 degrees is enough on a commuter airport [FS#1422] (r11408)
- Fix: In rare cases OpenTTD could segfault when resizing and scroll the main window (r11405)
- Fix: Manually replacing a vehicle with shared orders makes it lose it is order index and service interval [FS1384] (r11370)
- Fix: Road vehicles must not drive through each other on bridges/in tunnels [FS#1258] (r11366)
- Fix: When stopping a ship or aircraft, set their speed to 0 so they will not continue at the speed where they were stopped at [FS#1288] (r11365)
- Fix: Cloning vehicles with non-standard sub-cargotypes (i.e. livery refits) failed [FS#1380] (r11362)
- Fix: Loading too many GRFs was not handled gracefully causing crashes and such [FS#1377] (r11355)
- Fix: Add missing elrail sprites for some rail build buttons/cursors (r11350)
- Fix: Trees can now be planted on bare land without making it grassy, planting tree in desert does not make it grassy for the first tile-cycle and when a tree dies in desert, it no longer becomes a snowy tile for the first tile-cycle (r11244)
- Fix: The explosion vehicles were placed too far to the south [FS#1312] (r11234)
- Fix: One could sell vehicles that were crashed in a depot, which would still yield money/one could construct trains of crashed vehicles [FS#1307, FS#1228] (r11229, r11230)
- Fix: Electric trains were not shown as stopped in depots when converting it from elrail -> normal rail [FS#1260] (r11167)
- Fix: A lot of graphical glitches by changing some bounding boxes. It is not perfect yet, but a *very* good step into the right direction (r11128)
- Fix: When autorenew is enabled and it cannot renew the vehicle anymore (because the player cannot build the engine), the ageing warnings as if autorenew is not enabled are shown [FS#553] (r11064)
- Fix: Inconsistency between rail<->elrail conversions of different kinds of rail containing tiles (normal rail, stations, depots, etc) [FS#1182] (r11059)
- Fix: Crash when having the Finance window opened of the player you are cheating to [FS#1177] (r11028)
- Fix: Switching players (using the cheat) crashed on Big Endian machines [FS#1150] (r11023)
- Fix: The canal border determination did not take oil rigs into consideration (r11022)

- Fix: One could not give money when (s)he had too much money or rather: when casting the amount of money to an int32 becomes negative [FS#1174] (r11020)
- Fix: When determining the gender of a string, do not assume that the gender is in the front of the string when there can be case switching code at that location [FS#1104] (r10792)
- Fix: Determining whether there is a tunnel going under the lowered area is only needed in two directions instead of all four, so take the directions (one for each axis) to the nearest border (along the given axis) [FS#1058] (r10686)
- Fix: Graphical glitches when the "link landscape toolbar" patch is turned on when opening one of the construction toolbars [FS#1076] (r10685)
- Fix: Trolly AI did not know about steep slopes, and used wrong tileh in some cases [FS#1070] (r10655)

- Fix: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open [FS#1026] (r10546)
- Fix: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable [FS#1028] (r10541)
- Fix: Error dialog was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command [FS#1015] (r10501)
- Fix: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)
- Fix: When landscape generating, allow for 200ms between screen updates instead of updating every 200ms. Previously slow screen updates would result in very slow map generation (r10396)
- Fix: One could only build a limited number of stations before one had to rename them [FS#278] (r10320)
- Fix: Acceleration not calculated properly when a train goes up a hill between tunnels [FS#786] (r10317)
- Fix: [YAPF] Now it is no longer needed to invalidate the YAPF segment cache every tick in MP (read performance increase). Segment cost now does not contain the curves between segments. As a result the cache should be now accurate (r10302)
- Fix: [YAPF] Assertion triggered in some special cases [FS#901] (r10301)
- Fix: Flush stdout on dedicated server output to ensure an update of stdout [FS#775] (r10295)
- Fix: With smooth_economy, when industry production hit 32, it stayed there for ever. Give it some chance to get out of that uber-lowness (although it is a very slim chance, at least it has one) (r10290)
- Fix: Also age engines that are not front-engines [FS#202] (r10288)
- Fix: Money overflow bugs in many locations [FS#723] (r10212)

- Fix: Separate engine class and engine running cost class (r9799)
- Fix: Clone vehicles will no longer refit for free (r9689)
- Fix: Improved loading does not use a huge amount of processing power anymore when having a lot of trains [FS#423] (r9683)
- Fix: Truncate the NewGRF information text in the NewGRF GUI if it is too long (r9449)
- Fix: Cancel in password queries reduces amount of players in the network game when they have not joined the game yet [FS#688] r9378
- Fix: If all news-setting buttons show 'full', make the ALL-button show 'full' too (r9137)
- Fix: Open and close messages now have their own setting, so you can hide economy changes, but do show open/close of industries [FS#525] (r9097)
- Fix: Do not make owner signs transparent, as then you loose the information who it owns [FS#637] (r9067)
- Fix: Store the owner of a statue, so when it gets removed, the town is notified of it [FS#638] (r9066)
- Fix: Inactive connections are not automatically kicked, i.e. people who only open a telnet (or similar) connection to a server [FS#115] (r9038)
- Fix: Do not select a disabled platform length/number of track count when going out of drag-drop mode [FS#450] (r8999)
- Fix: Make an aircraft at 400 km/h go as fast as a train at 400 km/h (r8973)
- Fix: You were unable to build roads in the scenario editor when there is no town 0, even though there are other towns (r8608)
- Fix: Road Vehicles now can obtain a slot even if the station is very spread out [FS#577] (r8536)
- Fix: Allow lumber mill to cut trees only when they are full grown (r8535)
- Fix: Segmentation fault when the toolbar gets removed and you have selected one of the items in a sub menu of the toolbar (r8533)
- Fix: Remove phantom oil rigs sometimes present in old savegames (r8485)
- Fix: When a station is removed, vehicles do not get excessive payment any longer, as the origin TILE is now stored as long as the origin STATION for the transported cargoes (r8144)
- Fix: The game could crash when the chat key (<ENTER>) is pressed too vehemently during the join of the game. Your client's id does not exist in the clients list yet, and returns NULL (r8132)
- Fix: Rail vehicles can no longer enter tunnels or bridgeheads with wrong railtype (r7976)
- Fix: When path finding onto a bridge or tunnel end from previous tile (but not warping from the opposite end) check the enter direction. This fixes signal setting if a rail ends on the top of a tunnel end (r7718)
- Fix: When following path for signals, do not skip back to the previous tile, as for tunnels and bridge ends the entering direction is wrong (r7717)
- Fix: [YAPF] suppress 'Train is lost' message if path finding ended on the first two-way red signal due to YAPF.rail_firstred_twoway_eol option (r7628)
- Fix: [OPF] signal update was incorrectly propagated (r7620)

- Fix: Trains would not get flooded when they are at the lower part of a tile that would become a coast tile after flooding [FS#1127] (r10892)
- Fix: Removing road with the road removal tool would also work with a negative bank account, making the bank account even more negative than it was [FS#1125] (r10890)
- Fix: Some isocodes were wrong, resulting in some NewGRF not working properly for the affected languages (r10877)
- Fix: [Windows] Do not try to minimise or restore the window when closing OpenTTD [FS#998] (r10835)

- Fix: Ship's maximum speed wrongly shown [FS#1013] (r10497)
- Fix: [OSX] Of the resolution is changed to something that is too high for the monitor, then it is reduced to fit the monitor size, solving several crashes and graphical glitches [FS#458] (r10410)
- Fix: NPF was leaking memory each time it got initialized, except for the first time (r10357)
- Fix: [YAPF] 'target_seen' flag that is set prematurely in some cases (1 tile long cached segment followed by target station) which caused asserts to trigger [FS#884] (r10199)

- Feature: Make the client list window (for network games) stickyable (r10293)
- Feature: console command to get the current game date (r10137)
- Fix: Waypoints could be renamed when you are not the owner (r10368)
- Fix: Smooth economy did not close primary industries and it allowed increasing of production of industries that should not have rising productions (r10348, r10347, r10290)
- Fix: Acceleration for trains on slopes is not calculated properly [FS#786] (r10344, r10317)
