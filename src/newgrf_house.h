/**
 * Makes class IDs unique to each GRF file.
 * Houses can be assigned class IDs which are only comparable within the GRF
 * file they were defined in. This mapping ensures that if two houses have the
 * same class as defined by the GRF file, the classes are different within the
 * game. An array of HouseClassMapping structs is created, and the array index
 * of the struct that matches both the GRF ID and the class ID is the class ID
 * used in the game.
 *
 * Although similar to the HouseIDMapping struct above, this serves a different
 * purpose. Since the class ID is not saved anywhere, this mapping does not
 * need to be persistent; it just needs to keep class ids unique.
