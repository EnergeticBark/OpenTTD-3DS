Text=This version of OpenTTD has support for UNICODE, allowing users to use non-ASCII character sets such as Russian or Japanese.\r\nSelecting such a language will result in an unusable and garbled interface. You will need to specify a font that has support for these characters in openttd.cfg, or alternatively use an appropiate grf file.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to the readme or the wiki.
