;
; Example file for the OpenTTD Base Graphics replacement sets.
; This file consists of basically two different parts:
;  * metadata
;  * information about the files
;
; Metadata contains information about the name, version and palette
; of the graphics set.
;
; == Getting started ==
; - you can't add comments after values
; - you have to fill the MD5 checksum for each file
; - you may not miss any of the metadata or files items
; - `openttd -h` lists all graphics replacements sets it found to be correct
; - `openttd -d grf=1` shows warnings/errors when parsing an .obg file
; - `openttd -I <name>` starts OpenTTD with the given set (case sensitive)
; - adding `graphicsset = <name>` to the misc section of openttd.cfg makes
;   OpenTTD start with that graphics set by default
; - there is a command line tool for all platforms called md5sum that can
;   create the MD5 checksum you need.
; - all files specified in this file are search relatively to the path where
;   this file is found, i.e. if the graphics files are in a subdir you have
;   to add that subdir to the names in this file to! It will NOT search for
;   a file named like specified in here.

[metadata]
; the name of the pack, preferably less than 16 characters
name         = example
; the short name (4 characters), used to identify this set within NewGRFs
shortname    = XMPL
; the version of this graphics set (read as single integer)
version      = 0
; a fairly short description of the set
description  = foo
; palette used by the set; either DOS or Windows
palette      = DOS

; The files section lists the files that replace sprites.
; The file names are case sensitive.
[files]
; GRF file with the base sprites
base         = TRG1.GRF
; GRF file with logos, original terrain generator sprites
logos        = TRGI.GRF
; GRF file with extra arctic sprites
arctic       = TRGC.GRF
; GRF file with extra tropical sprites
tropical     = TRGH.GRF
; GRF file with extra toyland sprites
toyland      = TRGT.GRF
; NewGRF file using Actions 5, 7, 9 and A to replace sprites
extra        = OPENTTDD.GRF

; The md5s section lists the MD5 checksum for the files that replace them.
; Note that the list of files is case sensitive. Each GRF listed in the
; files section must be listed here with it's MD5 checksum, otherwise you
; will get a lot of warnings when starting OpenTTD.

; The origin section provides the possibility to put and extra line into
; the warning that a file is missing/corrupt. This can be used to tell
; them where to find it. It works on the filename specified in the
; files section and if that is not found it will fall back to the default
; as shown below here.
